digitcount
==========

I was asked to solve a problem, given a range of integers from `a to b` count every digits encountered in given range. 
For Ex.
```
  input --> 1-12
  Output 
  0 2
  1 5
  2 2
  3 1
  4 1
  5 1 
  6 1 
  7 1
  8 1
  9 1
```  
obiviously there is a simple solution like loop through range and count digit encountered, but thanx to post by an mathematician  http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?p=1741600#1741600

I have written both solution simple one and tricky one to compare my code, written code takes one input upper limit, it counts the digits from `0 to input`
